MSRefine directly reads vendor data generated from Thermo Scientific Orbitrap, Bruker timsTOF Pro and SCIEX ZenoTOF instruments and extracts 47 metrics over the whole LC-MS/MS workflow. These metrics are divided into sample, chromatography, dynamic sampling, ion source, MS1/MS2 signal and identification result. The specific meanings of metrics are provided in the Table S1. More importantly, we divide the influence of metrics on the identification results into acquisition, identification and redundancy (Figure 1A). Furthermore, a scoring system is established in MSRefine. More appropriate strategies for deeper proteome profiling can be discovered directly and effectively through a report containing scores and various graphs generated by MSRefine. For different kinds of samples and instruments, a set of optimal parameters can also be quickly determined to identify more peptides and proteins according to the scoring system and comprehensive report. Altogether, these features make MSRefine a valuable software tool for evaluating and optimizing the performance of experiments for deeper proteome profiling.
